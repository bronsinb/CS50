                <p>
                    My name is Bronsin Benyamin Pouran and I am a recent graduate from San Jose State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a 3.8 out of 4 GPA. With the completion of my degree, I also received a Basic Certificate in Cybersecurity Fundamentals.

                    Currently, I am a self-employed/freelance mobile application developer where I develop iOS and Android applications using various tools such as Visual Studio, Xcode, Flutter, and Android Studio. During my time as a mobile application developer, I have developed and published two applications on the App Store and Play Store. At the moment, I am developing apps for iOS and Android using Flutter, Dart, and Google Firebase.

                    On top of mobile app development, I have experience in database management with Firebase and MySQL, computer networks, web development, agile development process, and version control with git, GitHub, and bitbucket. In terms of programming languages, I have experience in Java, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Dart, Python, and Swift.

                    Now Iâ€™m looking to take my career to the next level by working as a full-time software engineer at a company where I can apply my skills and learn new ones, and transition from a student to an engineer.
