# Project 0

For Project 0, I created a resume website going over who I am, what I have studied so far, and what my work and volunteer experiences are. The website is created using Bootstrap 4.

Html file index.html is the main menu page containing my picture, my current position, my degree, and my age. The file also contains link buttons to the aboutme.html, education.html, and experience.html. The page uses two Bootstrap columns, the card component, and a table.

Html file aboutme.html is a simple page that gives a brief description of my professional history. This page also uses the card component.

Html file education.html is a page that contains the university I went to, what degree and certificate I obtained, and the projects I completed. This page uses the card component with an unordered list to list my projects.

Html file experience.html is a page that contains my work and volunteer experience. This page uses the card component, unordered lists, and ids to create a table of contents on the top.

Sass file stylesheet.scss contains all the css code, scss variables, scss nesting, and scss inheritance to style the website and make it mobile-responsive.
